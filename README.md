Conway's Game of Life https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

This was a project for my CS 1400 class which then carried over into the 1410 class where Robert Davis and 
I implemented a GUI for algorithm we had made. We made an option to choose whatever size you wanted (up to 60x60) 
and the capability to save and load whatever design you wanted to keep for that specific size.  We have a reset 
button which will clear the game board allowing you to try different patterns. There is a random button which 
will randomly decide which cells come alive at the start.

This GUI keeps track of how many cells are alive, dead, and how many were once alive but are now dead with 3 
different colors. It also keeps track of how many generations your game has survived (how many loop iterations 
have happened) and will display it right in front of your face.
